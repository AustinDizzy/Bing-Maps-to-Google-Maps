Bing Maps to Google Maps
------------------------

[Per request on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/1s0dza/extension_request_could_someone_please_write_a/), a simple Chrome Extension that adds a button to Bing Maps (embeded maps to come whenever I feel like it) that opens it in Google Maps.
